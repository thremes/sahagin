 * "Kid...The minute you start talking about who can win in a Nen fight, you're wrong.
 * In most cases, you won't know your opponent's abilities. One instant of carelessness
 * is all it takes to turn the tables and cost a life. You can't make assumptions based on
 * the amount of aura displayed. The battle can turn at any point. That's what fighting
 * with Nen means." ~ Morel McCarnathy | Hunter x Hunter
